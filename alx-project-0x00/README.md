Overview
Mastering advanced project structuring techniques in a React project using TypeScript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. Proper project structure is crucial for maintaining scalability, readability, and ease of collaboration, especially as your application grows in complexity. This guide will cover best practices for organizing a code, setting up modular components, managing state, and handling styles efficiently.

Advanced Project Structuring in Next.js
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
